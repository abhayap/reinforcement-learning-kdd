## Overview 
Reinforcement Learning is the _computational_ approach to learning from interaction (Sutton & Barto). Autonomous agents performing goal-oriented learning based on experience is the holy grail of AI. Recent successes of Reinforcement Learning algorithms include [human-level performance on many Atari games](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf), [beating world's best Go player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero), and robots learning [dexterity](https://blog.openai.com/learning-dexterity/) and [grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10293). Despite these successes, industrial applications of RL outside of organizations with easy access to large-scale compute and software infrastructure remain sparse. Wide-spread applications of RL require more sample efficient algorithms and new software tools for doing distributed computing. Our goal with this tutorial is two-fold:

>Provide a solid conceptual foundation for understanding and evaluating the existing state of the art RL methods (both strengths and weaknesses).
>Showcase Ray, an emerging distributed execution framework, for experimenting with and deploying large-scale Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

We believe that RL works well on applied problems where: 1.) Gathering simulations and experience is cheap, e.g. games, narrow-domain robotics; 2.) Modellers have access to a compact representation of the environment dynamics to apply approximate dynamic programming. During the tutorial, we will also deep-dive into practical applications of RL such as [optimizing tax collections with constrained value iteration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLsCuN6PQCE), [predicting market micro-structure for better trade execution](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/rlexec.pdf), and others alike. 

## Enviornments

While portions of the tutorial will focus on conceptual foundations and applied case studies, we will do hands-on implementations of the algorithms on standard Reinforcement Learning environments for debugging and pedagogical purposes.

<h2 id='install'> Installation & Prerequisites </h2>

### Installation
#### Option 1: JupyterHub
We will set up a JupyterHub OAuth for the workshop which will be available for attendees to register into with their GitHub account. 

#### Option 2: Installations your own Computer 
- Create a directory for this workshop with `mkdir rl-kdd`.
- `cd` into your `rl-kdd` directory. Create a `virtualenv` associated with the tutorial. Checkout more detailed instructions for OS specific `virtualenv` creation [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/).
- Activate the previously created `virtualenv`. 
- Clone this [repo](https://github.com/vruvora/reinforcement-learning-kdd.git).
- `cd` into the cloned repo. While the `virtualenv` is active, `pip install -r requirements.in` to download the associated packages. 
  - If you are having issues with `gym[atari]` installation, make sure you have the following [dependencies](https://github.com/openai/gym#installing-everything). 
- Test installation works properly by: 
  - Running `python tests/random_agent.py`. 
  - Running `python tests/rllib_test.py`. 
 
_Side Note: Make sure you are using `python 3.6.4`_

### Prerequisites 
This tutorial will require a solid foundations in Machine Learning, Python Programming, and basic familiarity with popular Deep Learning frameworks like Tensorflow and Torch.
